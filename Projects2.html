        <h2>Problem</h2> <br>
          <p>"How can we encourage individuals who buy their own groceries to shop more at locally sourced markets to 
          minimize the impact of their shopping habits on the environment?"</p>
          <br><br>

        <h2>Goals</h2> <br>
          <p>"The goal is to adopt more environmentally sustainable practices that will have a positive impact on the world."</p>
          <br><br>
          <div class="line"></div><br>

        <h2>Solution</h2> <br><br>
            <p> 
                1. Create an Account &mdash; users can create an account from 2 options, 'Customer' or 'Business Owner'
                <br><br>
                2. Search Markets &mdash; users can type in specific keywords to find markets in the search bar.
                <br><br>
                3. Locate Nearby Markets &mdash; users are prompted to share location or enter in zipcode, search markets with side navigation bar,
                and when the cursor is hovered over a market, their business profile link will appear.
                <br><br>
                4. Find Profile Page &mdash; customers can view market information -- location, address, operation hours, current open status, review, etc.
                <br><br>
                5. Write Google Reviews &mdash; users can read previous reviews and write new reviews with a brief description and rating on a scale of 1 - 5.
                <br><br>
                6. Submit a Question &mdash; users can voice by submitting their questions through the 'Help' page.

              <p> Meet Sarah, a busy working professional who prioritizes convenience over everything else. 
                  She does her grocery shopping wherever is most convenient for her, without giving much thought to where the products come from. 
                  However, she is starting to become more aware of the impact of how she shops and is looking for ways to make a change. Sarah is the
                  perfect target for the "Farmer's Market Finder" website as she seeks to balance her busy lifestyle with her desire to live a 
                  more sustainable life.</p>
                  <br><br>
              <p> Our team conducted interviews with 12 individuals belonging to various groups - college students, adults, parents, and elders -
                  to gain insights into our target audience. The findings revealed that the typical user is a busy professional or student 
                  who values healthy living, hobbies, spends time with friends & family. Eating healthy is considered important, 
                  but only when it is both convenient and affordable for them.</p>

                <p> Meet Sarah, a busy working professional who values the convenience of shopping at the grocery store nearest to her office. She often
                relies on pre-packaged meals and ready-to-eat snacks, as they are quick and easy to prepare. However, Sarah is becoming increasingly 
                concerned about the negative impact her shopping habits have on the environment and her health. She wants to find a way to continue
                eating healthily while also reducing her carbon footprint. Sarah is struggling to find affordable and convenient sources of fresh produce,
                and is looking for a solution that will help her make more informed and sustainable shopping choices.
                <br><br>
                <p> In the designing process, I considered the challenges Sarah faced in finding affordable, healthy, and readily available food options 
                    and her desire to reduce her carbon footprint. Our team outlined several ideas to address these problems, including the encouragement
                     of shopping at the local farmer's market. Customers can purchase high-quality food that are sourced locally, thereby reducing the 
                     negative environmental impact of transportation. By supporting local farmers, users like Sarah can access fresh, whole foods that 
                     are better for their health and the environment.

            <p> Guided Cognitive Walkthroughs – Our team gave guided walkthroughs to 12 users and provided them with  the purpose, stakeholders/users, a set of instructions to navigate through the website, and assistance when needed. After observing users interacting with our website, we made evaluation reflections based on our designs and insight from the users. 
                Darken the map frame when a pop-up appears to help users focus on the display box.
                Ensure the prototype is consistent. For example, show that the user is logged in on every screen after they created an account
                Choose the colors of the text and pop-up bubbles carefully on the map to support easy readability and functionality for users.

          <h2>Reflections:</h2>
            <p> After I completed the Farmer's Market Finder website, I understood the general process of what it’s like 
                to be a Human Centered-Design & Development major. This is my first time running through a design process
                and creating a prototype from scratch. I learned the importance of organization in the project, communicating
                clearly with my group, and making reiterations to features that weren’t effective. After the testing stage, 
                we changed some of our original use cases and ideas to fit what works best with the users. Working on this 
                project to create a technology that can solve global issues kept me interested in learning about the types
                of opportunities I can pursue in this career path. </p>

        <h2>Problem: </h2> 
        <br>
          <p>"How can we guide students in following a career path that fits what they are looking for?"</p>
            <br> <br>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <br>
          <p> Our goal is to offer networking resources for students to connect with like-minded indivduals and 
            create a personalized academic career plan using the PLANK test (AI). Users can select from various 
            plans that outline majors, minors, classes, and career prospects based on a chosen university.

        <h2>Solution</h2> <br><br>
            <p> 
                1. View Feed (home) &mdash; users can create an account from 2 options, 'Customer' or 'Business Owner'
                <br><br>
                2. Network with Others &mdash; users can type in specific keywords to find markets in the search bar.
                <br><br>
                3. Network with Others &mdash; users are prompted to share location or enter in zipcode, search markets with side navigation bar,
                and when the cursor is hovered over a market, their business profile link will appear.
                <br><br>
                4. Send a Message &mdash; customers can view market information -- location, address, operation hours, current open status, review, etc.
                <br><br>
                5. Create a Profile &mdash; users can read previous reviews and write new reviews with a brief description and rating on a scale of 1 - 5.

            Our team  interviewed 12 users in the following groups, college students, adults, parents, and elders, to

            and chooses to eat healthy when it’s convenient & affordable. </p>

           <h2>Reflection</h2> <br><br>
              <p> Working on STARS increased my awareness of the difficulty that surrounded mental health. There is no one solution that can be the answer
                that everyone is looking for, but there are many things I believe that can lead a person to a better life. With this project, I reflected on
                habits that made a positive impact on my productivity and mind. From my experiences, I understood that changing one single habit can make
                a significant change in my life and that can be as simple as taking a deep breath or drinking more water. I took consideration into my team
                members' & I's personal experience, alongside research, that led to the solutions we designed for STARS. I learned that collaborating with a
                group can be challenging because there needs to be clear communication, organization, and leadership in order for us to execute our goal 
                efficiently. I also learned that it can be rewarding because of what we can create with everyone working on the same side for the same goal.
